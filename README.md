# Weather-Dashboard

## The Weather Dashboard App allows a user to see weather for an inputed city current and the weather for that city the next 5 days

## Details:
### This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain information on the weather in a given city
### The user will input a city into the search bar on the left side of the page
### This entered city will then appear below as a button. The current forecast & the 5-day forcast will also appear for that city
### The buttons that appear below are usable as the user can select one of these buttons and the page will update back to that city's weather forcast 

### Other Key Details:
### The UV Index should appear as green, yellow, red, or purple depending on the UV in that city where green is good (low) and purple is bad (high)
### An icon representing the weather should appear for the current day next to the city name and should also appear on each day of the 5-day forecast
